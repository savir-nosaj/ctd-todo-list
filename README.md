## Installation Instructions

1. In your terminal, create a directory and `cd` into it
2. run `npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react`
- npm create …: we're using npm's create command. create is an alias of the init command which creates our package.json file.
- … vite@latest …: this argument tells npm to scaffold the project using Vite's newest package.
- … ./ … lets npm know to use the current directory.
- … -- … forwards the remaining options to the package used to scaffold the project.
- … --template react tells vite's package to scaffold the project using its React template.
3. run `npm install`

## Running Development Server
1. In the project root directory, run `npm run dev`
- This will call the dev script, located in the package.json file
- Will spin up a development pipeline to create a version of our code that is understandable by the browser.
- Vite then serves up the transformed code so we can see it in the browser!
2. Copy the URL provided in terminal and paste in browser to open project
